# Go HTTP Server
A lightweight HTTP server built from scratch in Go.
Supports video streaming and file downloading.

## Run the server
``go run main.go``

## Features
- Custom HTTP server
- Routing
- Video streaming
- File downloading
- Pure Go (no external deps)

Note:= don't forget to have video in directory 
created that HTTP server from scratch by using low-level 
system calls to set up a socket connection through the syscall module.
As we know, both HTTP and TCP are protocols, but HTTP defines the rules
for how data is exchanged between applications (data type, format, headers, etc.), 
while TCP defines how the actual data is transported between machines. 
Since TCP is already implemented by the kernel, I didn’t need to build it from scratch.
Because HTTP runs on top of TCP, I just configured TCP using syscalls and then implemented
my own HTTP rules on top of it. If that’s still confusing, think of it this way:
both HTTP and TCP are sets of rules, but TCP is provided by the kernel,
while I defined my own HTTP rules myself.
